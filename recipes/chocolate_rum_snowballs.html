    <p>These chocolate rum snowballs put a seasonal twist on the classic rum ball, which is one of the easiest, most delicious no-bake cookies ever. For the full snowball effect, these are coated in white chocolate, then rolled in coconut, but you can also finish them more simply by rolling them generously in powdered sugar.</p>
